# Cell Type Classifier

Project to classify cell types from single-cell gene expression data. Trying out logistic regression, Random Forest, PyTorch Neural Network.

## Overview

This project takes single-cell RNA sequencing data and predicts the cell type (e.g., T cell, B cell, macrophage) based on gene expression.
